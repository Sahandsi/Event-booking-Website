<h2>About Private Air Charter</h2>
<p>
    Once people have used our services they tend to make a habit of it. That in itself is tribute to the name of Private Jet Charter. An impeccable reputation means everything to us, and to the many, varied clients who trust us to deliver their high expectations every day of the year. We have worked hard to become one of the most respected aircraft charter brokers in the world – a position we continue to protect with utmost care.
<p>
    Financial stability and a continued commitment to organisations which regulate high industry standards also reassure clients of our dedication - not just to previous achievements, but to the future of aviation and Private Jet Charter’s place within it.
<p>
    <h3>Guarantee</h3>
<p>
    It’s a simple fact of life that, even with meticulous organisation, external factors can suddenly make Plan A unattainable. The advantage of chartering with us is that we possess the resources to have a Plan B and Plan C waiting in the wings.
<p>
    That’s why we guarantee to do everything possible to deliver our promises to you, without it ever becoming your problem.

    Considering our unrivalled access to the world’s largest fleet of aircraft, our commitment to service and extensive experience, we make a pretty powerful team to have on your side in the world of private flights.

   <h3>Our Fleet</h3> 
<p>
    Private Jet Charter has the most technologically advanced private aircraft ready to provide professional VIP service either for business or leisure. All aircraft are readily available for any charter service and are powered by CATS, the most effective aviation tracking system to track and locate hundreds of aircraft in a matter of minutes.
<p>
    <h3>Our Contract</h3>
